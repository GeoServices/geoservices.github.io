      <h2>GeoServices</h2>

      <p>GeoServices is a REST-based application programming interface that provides developers consistent and complete access to structured data. </p>

      <p>Using the API, developers can query data using a SQL-like where clause, geospatial and time filters, perform aggregations, sorting, text search, and spatial projection. Data are available in common [JSON](query.html) and [Image](view.html) formats.</p>

      <p>Originally <a href="http://www.esri.com/industries/landing-pages/geoservices/geoservices">developed by Esri</a>, <a href="http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2010/09/07/the-geoservices-rest-specification-an-open-standard-for-gis-web-services/">in 2010</a> the specification was transferred to the <a href="http://www.openwebfoundation.org/faqs/users-of-owf-agreements">Open Web Foundation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>To learn even more about all of the capabilities of GeoServices, read the <a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#/Working_with_services_you_ve_published/02r3000000tq000000/">full API documentation</a>.

      <h3>In a Nutshell</h3>

      <p>If you want to know just one thing about GeoServices - you can query for data using a location or attribute filters.
      </p>
      <p>Look up which U.S. county is at a specific latitude and longitude:
      </p>
      <pre>http://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb/Places_CouSub_ConCity_SubMCD/MapServer/15/query
        ?outFields=*
        &amp;geometryType=esriGeometryPoint
        &amp;geometry=-77.06930,38.89733
        &amp;inSR=4326
        &amp;f=json</pre>

        <p>Returns JSON with an array of <code>features</code>. The output is truncated below:
        </p>

<p>Or you can search for DC Public Schools that are Elementary and have between 200 and 1000 students within a map extent: <a href='http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Education_WebMercator/MapServer/5/query?where=FACUSE%20like%20%27%Elementary%%27%20AND%20TOTAL_STUD%20%3E=%20200%20AND%20TOTAL_STUD%20%3C=%201000%20&geometry={"xmin":-77.0036,"ymin":38.8879,"xmax":-76.98434,"ymax":38.90007,"spatialReference":{"wkid":4326}}%20&geometryType=esriGeometryEnvelope%20&inSR=4326%20&outFields=*' title="Query for DC Schools">[view live]</a>

<p>These two examples are probably the most common use cases for using the GeoServices API. Read on for more details on advanced features.</p>
